# BezKoder-Sequelize-One-To-Many

Server side code from this article:
https://www.bezkoder.com/sequelize-associate-one-to-many/#Source_Code
All the code is under the "server" directory. I like to keep the front end and backend code separate.
I might add a frontend to this project using Vue 2.

I used elint to keep my code adhere to certain style guidelines. It is a pain but I found it to be a good practice to follow.
Once you install eslint, you have to perform an additional step to make it work:
cd node_module/eslint
npm init @eslint/config

If you are using github, you need to add .eslingnore (it is part of the project in my git repository)

I used the exact versions of all the modules (listed in package.json) to ensure the 
code in the article works properly.
